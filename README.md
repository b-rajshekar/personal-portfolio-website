# personal-portfolio-website
Hello,

This is my first <a href="https://b-rajshekar.github.io/personal-portfolio-website/">Personal-Portfolio-Website</a>

Which I have built after completing freeCodeCamp WebDesign course, It is the last project from the curriculum,
I build this project with the help of the example project given in the course, and i made some little changes and make some changes to the color theme.

Hence, I'm happy with the output but it's just the beginning of my journy to the web development.
Will learn more about JavaScript and its frameworks and build more complex and advance webapps in the future :)
